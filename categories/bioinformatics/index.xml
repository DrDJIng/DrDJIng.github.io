      <description>This Rosalind problem deals with RNA. RNA differs slightly from DNA, in that the ribose is oxy&amp;rsquo;d instead of deoxy&amp;rsquo;d, and instead of (T)hymine is has (U)racil. The problem itself is pretty simple:
Given: A DNA string t having length at most 1000 nt.
Return: The transcribed RNA string of t.
My answer is as follows. Note this time I load in the string from a text object instead of copying it into the program itself, and output the answer into a text file as well.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s an offshoot of data science called Bioinformatics, and it&amp;rsquo;s essentially the study of how to extract meaningful information out of genetic information. Now, this sounds super cool, so I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to learn a bit about it. To help me with this, I&amp;rsquo;ll be doing the Rosalind problems, and posting my solution here.
The first problem is to do with DNA, and it&amp;rsquo;s a relatively simple one. All DNA (that I know of) is made up of four nucleotides attached in sequence, along with some deoxyribose sugars and some phosphate groups.</description>
