      <description>To date, I have something that kind of approximates the beginning of the program I want to make. I can set a stream of data to start, but can&amp;rsquo;t stop it. I can live-plot this data, but without much control. I have yet to integrate in signal generation while streaming, which I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure is possible, but am 100% sure is necessary.
The biggest thing I&amp;rsquo;ve learned so far is that I need to integrate multi-threading.</description>
