      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve dabbled a bit in machine learning (ML) before, having taking the introductory course by the famous Andrew Ng on Coursera. However, upon digging a bit deeper, MATLAB is somewhat outdated to use as a basis for ML tasks these days. Additionally, while the course provided a solid foundation for understanding different types of ML learning algorithms, from a more practical point of view it wasn&amp;rsquo;t as useful. Mostly because the majority of the assignments were mostly pre-filled, leaving the student to create one or two functions that were essentially copy-pasting a piece of math from the lecture slides into MATLAB.</description>
