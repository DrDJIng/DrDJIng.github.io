      <description>In a previous post, I mentioned how I was learning fastai methodology to create image recognition nets, with the ultimate goal of determining cloud types, and bee genus&amp;rsquo;. Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on it for a bit, I&amp;rsquo;m ready to show some of my progress, and I&amp;rsquo;ll start with my Bee classification net.
This post is about my bee net. Initially, the idea was to classify bees according to their genus, and this is still on the books for later.</description>
