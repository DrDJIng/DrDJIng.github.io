      <description>Rcently, I&amp;rsquo;ve been learning fastai methodology to create image recognition nets, with the ultimate goal of determining cloud types, and bee genus&amp;rsquo;. Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on it for a bit, I&amp;rsquo;m ready to show some of my progress, and I&amp;rsquo;ll start with my Bee classification net.
This post is about my bee net. Initially, the idea was to classify bees according to their genus, and this is still on the books for later.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve dabbled a bit in machine learning (ML) before, having taking the introductory course by the famous Andrew Ng on Coursera (LINK). However, upon digging a bit deeper, MATLAB is somewhat outdated to use as a basis for ML tasks these days. Additionally, while the course provided a solid foundation for understanding different types of ML learning algorithms, from a more practical point of view it wasn&amp;rsquo;t as useful. Mostly because the majority of the assignments were mostly pre-filled, leaving the student to create one or two functions that were essentially copy-pasting a piece of math from the lecture slides into MATLAB.</description>
