      <description>In an effort to populate my blog with content, I am on a bit of a content-making spree, so I apologise in advance if things are a bit odd.
Julia is a language that seems to be, in my opinion, a good point to move on from MATLAB. It promises C++ speed, with the high-level coding practices of MATLAB.
If you wrap your script in a function, you get your speedup.</description>

      <title>Learning fluid simulation!</title>

      <description>One of the things I have been working towards over the past couple of months is creating a fluid simulation program in Julia. While packages such as Lily-Pad, WaterLily, and FluidFlowSimulation.jl already exist, I want to actually learn how to do finite element numerical simulation!
Why do I want to do this? Well, I would like to become a game developer. Specifically, I want to work on some sort of physics system within a game.</description>
