      <description>This blog post was originally going to be about how great I am at making programs, and how my program was practically finished, etc. Unfortunately, however, real life has a way of bringing you back to reality, often in less than ideal ways.
This time, it brought me back with the realisation that because of USB limitations, I cannot multi-thread data from a streaming Labjack and simultaneously command/response a signal output with enough fine time control.</description>

      <description>My current job has me do a lot of random bits and pieces, very little coherent &amp;ldquo;This is your job&amp;rdquo; tasks. To date, I&amp;rsquo;ve created a website [LINK], studied Machine Learning, decided it was overkill for the image recognition program I then created, and helped to write a paper or two. Now, however, I am stepping well outside of my comfort area and attempting to modernize the interface between a computer and a two-decade old piece of lab equipment.</description>
