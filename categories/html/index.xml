      <description>So I had issues with getting Pelican to work on Windows (I game a lot, so Windows is more practical for me than a nix distribution), mostly with theme generation because I really didn&amp;rsquo;t want to have to learn yet another language, just to get a website up and running. I recently learned HTML5 and relatively modern CSS practices, including responsive design, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t particularly feel like branching out again so soon.</description>
