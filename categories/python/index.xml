      <description>To date, I have something that kind of approximates the beginning of the program I want to make. I can set a stream of data to start, but can&amp;rsquo;t stop it. I can live-plot this data, but without much control. I have yet to integrate in signal generation while streaming, which I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure is possible, but am 100% sure is necessary.
The biggest thing I&amp;rsquo;ve learned so far is that I need to integrate multi-threading.</description>

      <description>My current job has me do a lot of random bits and pieces, very little coherent &amp;ldquo;This is your job&amp;rdquo; tasks. To date, I&amp;rsquo;ve created a website [LINK], studied Machine Learning, decided it was overkill for the image recognition program I then created, and helped to write a paper or two. Now, however, I am stepping well outside of my comfort area and attempting to modernize the interface between a computer and a two-decade old piece of lab equipment.</description>
