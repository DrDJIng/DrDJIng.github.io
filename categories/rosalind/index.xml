      <description>This Rosalind problem deals with complementing DNA. So it should be as simple as telling the DNA is has really nice helical structure, right? Unfortunately not, though it is still simple. Each nucleotide can bond only to one other, in the manner A - T, and C - G, and these are the complements. So to find the complement of an entire DNA string, you just replace all the symbols with their counterpart, and funnily enough the reverse complement is the reverse of the complement.</description>

      <description>This Rosalind problem deals with a classic: The Fibonacci Sequence! It&amp;rsquo;s a recursive function that takes the two previous solutions to the function and adds them together. For this problem, it&amp;rsquo;s a touch more complex. Given a number of generations, n, and a number of offspring, k:
Given: Positive integers $n /lt 40$ and $k /gt 5$.
Return: The total number of rabbit pairs that will be present after n months, if we begin with 1 pair and in each generation, every pair of reproduction-age rabbits produces a litter of k rabbit pairs (instead of only 1 pair).</description>

      <title>Bioinformatics with Rosalind - RNA</title>

      <description>This Rosalind problem deals with RNA. RNA differs slightly from DNA, in that the ribose is oxy&amp;rsquo;d instead of deoxy&amp;rsquo;d, and instead of (T)hymine is has (U)racil. The problem itself is pretty simple:
Given: A DNA string t having length at most 1000 nt.
Return: The transcribed RNA string of t.
My answer is as follows. Note this time I load in the string from a text object instead of copying it into the program itself, and output the answer into a text file as well.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s an offshoot of data science called Bioinformatics, and it&amp;rsquo;s essentially the study of how to extract meaningful information out of genetic information. Now, this sounds super cool, so I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to learn a bit about it. To help me with this, I&amp;rsquo;ll be doing the Rosalind problems, and posting my solution here.
The first problem is to do with DNA, and it&amp;rsquo;s a relatively simple one. All DNA (that I know of) is made up of four nucleotides attached in sequence, along with some deoxyribose sugars and some phosphate groups.</description>
