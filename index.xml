      <title>Labjack take 3</title>

      <description>So the new U3&amp;rsquo;s came in, and they are very sleek. I also ordered some of the LJ-Tick addons, which take a couple of open FIO (flexible I/O) ports and &amp;ldquo;converts&amp;rdquo; them to DAC&amp;rsquo;s (digital analog control [I think]) with +/- 10 V capabilities.
So this delivery of hardware should solve the two big problems that I was having when using a single U6 - namely that the DAC&amp;rsquo;s on any of the U-series Labjacks only support a USB voltage of0-4 V (at least to my knowledge), and a serious timing issue I was having while attempting to stream data whilst simultaneously sending read/write commands.</description>

      <title>Reworking the LabJack interface</title>

      <description>This blog post was originally going to be about how great I am at making programs, and how my program was practically finished, etc. Unfortunately, however, real life has a way of bringing you back to reality, often in less than ideal ways.
This time, it brought me back with the realisation that because of USB limitations, I cannot multi-thread data from a streaming Labjack and simultaneously command/response a signal output with enough fine time control.</description>

      <title>Starting in Game Development</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a man of many ideas. Wanting to develop a simple game, then move onto more complex ones, is one of those ideas. Of course, many have done this before me and many will after me, so I have no qualms about standing on the shoulders of giants, and using a game engine that suits my needs.
Now, onto that. In the game engine world, there are two contenders that everyone knows about (so far as I can tell).</description>

      <title>A simple speed comparison between MATLAB and Julia</title>

      <description>In an effort to populate my blog with content, I am on a bit of a content-making spree, so I apologise in advance if things are a bit odd.
Julia is a language that seems to be, in my opinion, a good point to move on from MATLAB. It promises C++ speed, with the high-level coding practices of MATLAB.
If you wrap your script in a function, you get your speedup.</description>

      <title>Is it a wasp or a bee?</title>

      <description>In a previous post, I mentioned how I was learning fastai methodology to create image recognition nets, with the ultimate goal of determining cloud types, and bee genus&amp;rsquo;. Now that I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on it for a bit, I&amp;rsquo;m ready to show some of my progress, and I&amp;rsquo;ll start with my Bee classification net.
This post is about my bee net. Initially, the idea was to classify bees according to their genus, and this is still on the books for later.</description>

      <title>Static Site Generation with Hugo</title>

      <description>So I had issues with getting Pelican to work on Windows (I game a lot, so Windows is more practical for me than a nix distribution), mostly with theme generation because I really didn&amp;rsquo;t want to have to learn yet another language, just to get a website up and running. I recently learned HTML5 and relatively modern CSS practices, including responsive design, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t particularly feel like branching out again so soon.</description>

      <description>My current job has me do a lot of random bits and pieces, very little coherent &amp;ldquo;This is your job&amp;rdquo; tasks. To date, I&amp;rsquo;ve created a website [LINK], studied Machine Learning, decided it was overkill for the image recognition program I then created, and helped to write a paper or two. Now, however, I am stepping well outside of my comfort area and attempting to modernize the interface between a computer and a two-decade old piece of lab equipment.</description>
