      <description>Title: Speed comparison between MATLAB and Julia Author: David Ing Date: 23-04-2020 Category: Science Tags: Julia, Science, MATLAB
Julia is a language that seems to be, in my opinion, a good point to move on from MATLAB. It promises C++ speed, with the high-level coding practices of MATLAB.
If you wrap your script in a function, you get your speedup. At least that&amp;rsquo;s my understanding.
I wanted to test to see if Julia would actually run faster than MATLAB, so I dug deep into my memory core, and retrieved some MATLAB code from my initial days as a young physicist.</description>
